The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:   The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.   Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.   The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.   Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.   The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).   Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,   The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.   The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.   The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.   For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:   Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).   Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.   Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.   A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:   Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or   Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).   Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.   Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).   The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.   The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.   The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:   White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.   Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.   Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.   Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.   The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range).   The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:   Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.   Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.   The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.   If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.   Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).   For azoospermia, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the investigator\\'s/ designee\\'s medical examination of the subject or review of the subject\\'s medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject\\'s medical records.   Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.   Able to swallow and retain oral medication.   In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Exclusion Criteria:   The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the patient must not be included in the study:   The patient has received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin (cumulative dose) or > 600 mg/m2 epirubicin (cumulative dose).   The patient is receiving treatment with bisphosphonate UNLESS the biphosphonate treatment was initiated more than three weeks before the first ASCI administration. (See also section 5.3.2.).   The patient has received any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study treatment(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study treatment, or planned use during the study period.   The patient is currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to screening.   The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids or any immunosuppressive agents. The use of prednisone, or equivalent, <0.5 mg/kg/day (absolute maximum 40 mg/day), or inhaled corticosteroids or topical steroids is permitted.   The patient has a malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel.   Patients with ulcerative colitis.   The patient has known coronary artery disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, clinically significant valvular disease, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, ventricular hypertrophy (found by ECG) or previous myocardial infarction.   The patient has any acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.   The patient has current active hepatic or biliary\\'s disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert\\'s syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).

Women who are not menstruating regularly due to use of certain types of contraceptives may be entered with restrictions. Their estrogen progesterone, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels must be documented at baseline random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) and their off study RPFNA must take place at a similar portion of their cycle (high or low progesterone levels). In order to do this a serum progesterone will have to be obtained ~ 4 weeks before planned RPFNA and again 2 weeks later such that the RPFNA can be performed in the same phase of the \"cycle\" as baseline.   Subjects must be at increased risk for breast cancer on the basis of at least one of the following criteria:   A five-year Gail risk of  1.67% or three times the average risk for a woman of the same age using either the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER, http://seer.cancer.gov) database or the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool)., or 10 yr Tyrer-Cuzick risk twice that of the population risk as listed in model, or RPFNA atypia   BMI <40 Kg/m3   A first degree relative with breast cancer under the age of 60 or multiple second degree relatives with breast cancer.   Multiple prior biopsies or at least one prior biopsy exhibiting atypical hyperplasia (AH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).   RPFNA evidence of hyperplasia with atypia within the last three years;   Chest or neck radiation before age 30;   Mammographic breast density by visual estimate equals or exceeds 50%.   Subjects must be willing to continue the same hormonal milieu present at baseline throughout trial. If not using an oral, vaginal, or topical contraceptive, must be willing to actively use barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy.   Six months or more must have elapsed from completion of a prevention intervention trial (with exception of a weight reduction trial), ingestion of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or aromatase inhibitor (AI) prior to baseline biomarker assessment.   Subjects must be willing to undergo measurement of height, weight, and BMI and undergo body composite analysis (DEXA) at initiation and conclusion of intervention.   Subjects with a history of AH, LCIS, or ER-positive DCIS by diagnostic biopsy, must have been counseled about appropriate standard prevention therapies such as tamoxifen and are either not eligible or are not interested in standard prevention therapies. Women with DCIS must have had appropriate local therapy (lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy). If subject has had a DCIS, at least two months must have elapsed from surgery and/or radiation therapy to the involved breast. Only the contralateral (uninvolved breast) will be studied by RPFNA. The subject may not have had any radiation therapy to the contralateral breast to be studied   Subjects > 40 must have had a screening mammogram within 6 months of entering the interventional portion of the study and read as not suspicious for breast cancer or if suspicious must have completed all suggested tests including biopsy and found to have no evidence of cancer. Subjects of sufficient age and/or risk for a baseline mammogram must be willing to have an off-study mammogram performed 6 months after study entry.   Subjects must have had an RPFNA of the breast within six months prior to entering the intervention portion of the study and be willing to have another RPFNA at ~6.5 months after starting Lovaza™.

The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:   The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.   Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.   The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.   Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.   The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).   Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,   The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.   The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.   The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.   For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:   Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).   Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.   Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.   A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:   Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or   Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).   Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.   Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).   The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.   The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.   The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:   White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.   Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.   Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.   Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.   The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range).   The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:   Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.   Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.   The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.   If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.   Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).   For azoospermia, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the investigator\\'s/ designee\\'s medical examination of the subject or review of the subject\\'s medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject\\'s medical records.   Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.   Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old   The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.   Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.   Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.   The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.   At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:   Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.   Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.   Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.   The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:   total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and   alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and   aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.   Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.   Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.   Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.   The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:   Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.   Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.   Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.   Patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.   Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.   Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.

Prior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, capecitabine, or bevacizumab for any malignancy.   Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry. The only exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before study entry and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy.   Any of the following cardiac conditions:   angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;   history of documented congestive heart failure;   serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;   severe conduction abnormality;   valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; or   uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 150/90 on antihypertensive therapy.

(Patients on warfarin with an in-range international normalized ratio [INR] [usually between 2 and 3] are eligible.)   Other nonmalignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, diabetes, etc.) that would preclude the patient from receiving study treatment or would prevent required follow-up.   Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than/equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0).   Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids.   History of hypersensitivity reaction to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.   Therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.   Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 3 months after completion of bevacizumab.)   Pregnancy or lactation at the time of study entry.   Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study.

The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old   The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.   Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.   Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.   The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.   At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:   Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.   Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.   Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.   The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:   total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and   alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and   aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.   Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.   Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.   Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.   The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:   Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.   Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.   Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.   Patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.   Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.   Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry. Exclusion Criteria:   Tumor determined to be strongly HER2-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).

Prior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, capecitabine, or bevacizumab for any malignancy.   Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry. The only exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before study entry and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy.   Any of the following cardiac conditions:   angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;   history of documented congestive heart failure;   serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;   severe conduction abnormality;   valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; or   uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 150/90 on antihypertensive therapy. (Patients with hypertension that is well controlled on medication are eligible.)   History of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function.   History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).   History of other arterial thrombotic event within 12 months before study entry.

Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than/equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0).   Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids.   History of hypersensitivity reaction to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.   Therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.   Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 3 months after completion of bevacizumab.)   Pregnancy or lactation at the time of study entry.   Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study.

Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.   Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:   Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator\\'s discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.   The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)   Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.   Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.   Ineligibility Criteria   Male patients are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following conditions or prior therapies are also ineligible for this study:   Tumor that has been determined to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).   Contralateral breast cancer (invasive or DCIS) or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.   Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.   Clinical nodal stages including cN2b and cN3 or pathologic nodal stages including pN0(i+), pN2b, pN3b with clinically apparent internal mammary nodes, or pN3c.   Suspicious nodes in the contralateral axilla or suspicious supraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.   Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible).   Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.   Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy.   Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)   Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention.

Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from receiving any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.   History of hepatitis B or C.   Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception.   Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.   Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.   Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery   For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.   The following patients will be ineligible:   Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)   Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant.

Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.
