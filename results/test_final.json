The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.   The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe.

The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.   The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.   A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts.   Time frame: ~1 year. Women with negative or biopsy benign findings at baseline (study entry) were followed for 1 year to confirm the negative status at 1-year follow-up mammography exam.

The effects of BMN 673 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of BMN 673 administration.

Patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on therapy. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:   Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients who have had prior treatment with any PARP inhibitors are ineligible.   Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.   Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.   Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of BMN 673 will be determined following review by the principal investigator.   Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.   Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with BMN 673. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.   Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded. Low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic use.

For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).

The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=\"none\", 2=\"mild\", 3=\"moderate\", 4=\"severe\" and 5=\"very severe\" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).

The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.   The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The average daily hot flash score during the baseline week was compared to the average daily value during week 7.

The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.   The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.   A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts.   Time frame: ~1 year. Women with negative or biopsy benign findings at baseline (study entry) were followed for 1 year to confirm the negative status at 1-year follow-up mammography exam. Women diagnosed with cancer were not followed up.

Measurable disease- is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan.   Prior Therapy: Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic breast setting. Patients who have not received prior anthracyclines or taxanes should be considered for these agents. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy for early stage breast cancer. The chemotherapy regimen may have included an anthracycline and/or a taxane as long as it has been > 6 months since completion of the regimen. Adjuvant trastuzumab is allowed. Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either the metastatic or early stage setting as long as <25% of the bone marrow has been treated. Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is not allowed. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to study registration, and all radiation related toxicities must be resolved to grade  1 before patient is eligible for study inclusion. Patients may have received any number of hormonal therapies in the neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting.   Age >18 years.   Life expectancy of > 6 months.   Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <2.   Patients must have normal organ and marrow function. Laboratory tests should be completed within 14 days prior to starting study treatment. Only for patients who will be receiving trastuzumab, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may be determined by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, and should be obtained within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment.   Fertility/reproduction. Patients must not be pregnant, expect to become pregnant or conceive a child from time of first signing study consent until at least 12 weeks after last dose of study treatment.   Exclusion Criteria   Patients who have received prior vinca alkaloid chemotherapy are not eligible unless treatment was completed > 5 years ago.   Patients in which the HER2 status is unknown or is FISH negative will not receive trastuzumab but are eligible for treatment with single agent vinflunine.   Patients that have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.   Patients receiving trastuzumab must have received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin less than 360mg/m2, and/or an epirubicin cumulative dose less than 720mg/m2 for study entry.   Patients with known leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are excluded from this clinical trial   History of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions attributed to trastuzumab.   Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.   Pregnant women are excluded from this study   History of other non-breast cancer malignancy except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer, or in patients with greater than a 5-year disease free interval from a prior malignancy.
